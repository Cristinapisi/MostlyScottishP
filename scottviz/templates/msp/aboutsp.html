The <b>Scottish Parliament</b> also reffered to, in Gaelic, as <b>PÃ rlamaid na h-Alba</b>, is the devolved national,
unicameral legislature of Scotland. The current Parliament exists since May 12, 1999. This is the fourth session and it
will last for 5 years (until the 5 may 2016 elections). All previous sessions have been 4 years long
(1999-2003, 2003-2007, 2007-2011).
<br> <br>

There are (usually) 129 <b>Members of the Scottish Parliament</b>, reffered to, in short, as <a
        href="{% url 'msps' %}">MSPs</a>.
Out of the 129 members, 73 represent individual geographical constituencies and
56 are elected as 7 for each of the 8. Each person in Scotland is therefore represented
by 8: 1 for his constituency and 7 for his region. To find the MSPs that represents you, enter your full postcode in
